# ts-demo

A little project to represent how I set up my modern TypeScript projects! Usually I do my experimenting locally with Node, so I included the configuration for use with that. Setting up a plain frontend TypeScript web app usually looks a bit different, I can look into doing one for that as well. Maybe I should start making some videos on how to set things up like this :D
